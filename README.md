# Remote Config Demo

## Information
Firebase Remote Config is a cloud service provided by Google's Firebase platform that enables developers to change the behavior and appearance of their apps without publishing an app update. It allows you to define parameters or configurations on the Firebase console, and your app can then fetch and apply these configurations at runtime.

## Important
In this demonstration application, we remotely control and manage five categories of data:
- Boolean Data (True/False)
- JSON Data (Map<String, dynamic>)
- Numeric Data (Int/Double)
- Regular String Data
- Hexadecimal String Data
